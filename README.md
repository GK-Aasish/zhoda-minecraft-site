# ZHODA Minecraft-Themed Next.js Site

A ready-to-run Next.js project with a Minecraft-inspired UI: pixel font, block textures, enchantment glint on hover, and crack effect on button click.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000

## Pages
- `/` – Home
- `/server-ip` – Choose a server and copy its IP
- `/required-mods` – List of required mods

## Textures
Place your textures in `public/textures/` (currently placeholders):
- `stone.png` – page background
- `grass.png` – card background
- `planks.png` – button background
- `crack.png` – overlay on button press

Replace placeholders with textures from your own Minecraft resource pack for the authentic look.
